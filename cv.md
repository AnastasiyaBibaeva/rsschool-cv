Having worked in the retail sector for more than 10 years, I gained a lot of hard and soft skills.  Moreover, I became a tutor for new comers in this sphere.
But one day I realized that I want to work in a field where I could constantly develop.
Frontend attracts me with the opportunity to create a product that is user-friendly and attractive to the customer. As well as the need to look for the most concise and creative solutions from a huge number of variations.
I hope my previous experience will help me to master the necessary competencies faster.
